# C#
C# is the first language i learnt and i don't regret it.

It isn't a very hard language: It has many built in functions and garbage collection.

### Projects
I made:
- [Various Calculators](https://github.com/Totallynotnasaboi/CALCULATORS)
- Many simple Console programs
- A lot of games in Unity: the best one is [Asteroids](https://github.com/Totallynotnasaboi/Asteroids)


### Feels
I really like this language, yet i don't use it often.
