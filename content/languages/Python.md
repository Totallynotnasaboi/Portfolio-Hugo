# Python
Python is one of the first languages i learnt! It is really easy yet very much powerful.

### Projects
I made:
- [A "minecraft clone" with the ursina game engine](https://github.com/Totallynotnasaboi/Minecraft-python-edition)
- Various console programs
- Many discord bots

### Feels
I really like python because its accessible yet features packed and powerful. I love the management of external libraries.
