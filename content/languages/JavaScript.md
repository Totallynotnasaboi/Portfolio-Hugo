# JavaScript
Javascript is the language that i use the most, because you can do everything with JavaScript.

### Projects
- Many, Many API's
- Some desktop apps with electron
- Discord bots
- Minecraft bot
- Sites and apps with various frameworks

### Feels
I like this language, but i prefer TypeScript for its modern syntax and features. I utilize javascript maybe too much
